# Plant Splicer
Mix and match plant genetics to create beautiful images!

# Tips
- Press the Escape key to go back to the Main Menu
- The Editor closes with the Main render window
- In the Editor Window, Press Ctrl+S to save, Ctrl+O to open, Ctrl+P to splice Ctrl + M to splice and mutate (splicing and mutation requires paths to be provided in editor)
- When splicing, try to use plants that make use of a similar number of genomes
- Use more genomes
- Try to avoid negative colour change values, can lead to strange colours when splicing
- Avoid making direction spread too high
- Splicing keeps genes from each plant randomly, which means you get a different result from splicing every time
- Press "S" to take a screenshot
- Splice already spliced plants together!
- Adjust background colours in the editor settings
- Adjust zoom in editor settings
